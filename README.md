## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is crucial as it ensures there is delivery of the expected value ,prevents costs associated with delays and it upholds clients trust. Project Managers can ensure deadlines are met by, by clearly  defining project goals and timelines, using project management tools like asana and trello and ensuring effective team communication and resource allocation.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control ensures that the project remains within the proposed budget. It prevents resource shortages and improves profitability. Strategies thst can prevent budget overrun include: defining clearly the budget and tracking the expenses regularly, Monitoring scope creep and preventing unnecessary feature additions and using project management softwares to track spending.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each? 
Agile 
Advantages - it is flexible, iterative , enhances faster delivery and has better adaptability to changes.
Disadvantages - it is less structured and it requires strong team collaboration and its difficult to predict the final cost.

Waterfall
Advantages - It is well documented, predictable and its easier to manage for fixed scope projects.
Disadvantages - It is inflexible, when testing on the last stage, critical issues maybe uncovered.It is also not ideal for evolving requirements.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile - Best for projects with evolving requirements such as mobile app development or development of a web application.
Waterfall - Best for projects with clearly defined requirements such as banking systems.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Conducting unit testing, integration testing and system testing.
Implementing continous integration/ continous deployment (CI/CD).
Ensuring clean code standards.
Getting user feedback through beta testing.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
It ensures there is no scope creep, aligns project expectations, and it ensures resource allocation is accurate.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
It ensures task dependancies are understood by team members, project deadlines are met and resource allocation is efficient.
Gantt charts visualize the progress of the tasks, showing dependancies and the progress, making it easier to track milestones and adjust plans dynamically.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
My software plans to address issues on climate change. It aims to fill the gap that is currently there where people in their local communities can address issues in their environment such as illegal dumping and deforestation. A web app could be a good platform for communities to address issues in their locale and find solutions.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clearly defining the problem helps in developing a more effective software solution  by ensuring that the software directly addresses the specific challenge. 

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
My software is a web app that empowers local communities to take action against environmental issues like illegal dumping and deforestation. It provides a platform where users can report problems in their area, collaborate on solutions, and track progress. By connecting residents, environmental organizations, and local authorities, the app fosters community driven efforts to protect and restore the environment.
